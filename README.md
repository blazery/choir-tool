This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

This repo was created to store a tool i've been working on. Choir layout are something that changes semi-frequently, as each song can require a slightly different layout.

Working out a layout with 30+ different members using pen and paper can be quite a hassle, and is prone to being lost. Digitalizing this would make it way easier to create and share these layouyouts.

## Todo

-   improve styling
-   add support for pre determined risers
-   add support for different resolutions
-   add support for window resizing
-   add support for zooming and panning
-   add import / export capability
-   add screenshot capability
-   add support for IE and edge
-   add posibilty for icons in cards
